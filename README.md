## 🚀 About the Project

### 🌟Revolutionizing Diabetes Care & Global Healthcare with Artificial Intelligence 

This project harnesses cutting-edge **AI technologies** to tackle **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**, with a special focus on **diabetes management**. By employing **AI-powered tools** for **disease detection**, **accurate diagnosis**, and **treatment optimization**, we're driving transformative healthcare solutions. Starting our journey in **Nigeria**, we aspire to create healthcare systems that are more **predictive**, **personalized**, and **accessible**—especially for underserved communities. Together, we're revolutionizing healthcare and improving lives across the globe! 🌐💉✨

## 🏁 Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to set up the project and start changing the future of healthcare! 🚀

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have these tools installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v14.x or higher) 
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.org/)
- A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account for AI-powered features
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) with relevant ML libraries for model training and integration 

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nsiikak/AI-Diabetes-Health-Monitoring-System.git
   cd AI-Diabetes-Health-Monitoring-System
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the required packages.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the required packages.

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set Up the Database**:

   - Ensure MySQL (or your preferred SQL database) is installed and running 🖥️.
   - Create a new database for the project and update the database configuration in the `backend` folder.

   Example `.env` configuration:

   ```bash
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_USER=yourusername
   DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
   DB_NAME=health_monitoring
   ```

5. **Set Up Firebase**:

   - Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
   - Add your Firebase configuration details to the `.env` file:

   ```bash
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   ```

6. **Set Up the ML Models**:

   - Navigate to the `ml-models` folder.
   - Ensure you have Python and required libraries (e.g., `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, `Pandas`, etc.) installed.
   - Train the ML models (diabetes risk prediction, treatment optimization, etc.) using the provided datasets or any custom data.

## 🚀 Running Locally

Get the project up and running locally in just a few steps:

### Backend (NestJS) 🏗️

1. **Start the NestJS server**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000` ⚡.

### Frontend (React) 💻

1. **Start the React client**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

2. The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` 🚀.

### Machine Learning Models 

1. **Run the ML models**:

   Navigate to the `ml-models` folder and run the necessary scripts for prediction:

   ```bash
   cd ../ml-models
   python predict.py
   ```

   The trained ML models will analyze user inputs and provide health predictions.

### Access the Application 🌐

- **Frontend**: Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to access the user-friendly, interactive interface.
- **Backend API**: The API is available at `http://localhost:3000/api`.
