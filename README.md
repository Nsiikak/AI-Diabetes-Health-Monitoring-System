# AI-Driven Diabetes Health Monitoring System üåçüí°

**Revolutionizing Diabetes Care and Global Healthcare with Artificial Intelligence**

This project leverages **AI technologies** to address **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**, with a special focus on **diabetes management**. We use AI-powered tools for **disease detection**, **diagnosis**, and **treatment optimization**. Starting in Nigeria, we aim to make healthcare more predictive, personalized, and accessible for underserved communities.

### üöÄ Key Features:
- **Smart Diabetes Detection**: AI models for real-time health insights and early detection of diabetes.
- **Predictive Healthcare Models**: Machine learning algorithms to forecast diabetes-related risks and provide proactive healthcare suggestions.
- **AI-Powered Medical Chatbot**: A chatbot offering personalized health advice based on user inputs, enhancing access to healthcare information.
- **Optimized Treatment Plans**: AI tools to recommend medication and lifestyle changes, improving diabetes management.
- **Comprehensive Health Monitoring**: Monitors various health metrics, offering a holistic approach to healthcare beyond diabetes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: NestJS for scalable server-side logic, integrating Firebase and machine learning models for AI-driven functionalities.
- **Database**: SQL for managing user health data and historical records, ensuring robust and secure storage.
- **AI Integration**: Firebase for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to power the medical chatbot and provide health suggestions based on inputs.
