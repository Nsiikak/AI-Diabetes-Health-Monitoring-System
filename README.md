🚀 About the Project
The AI-Driven Diabetes Health Monitoring System is on a mission to transform global healthcare 🌍 by using cutting-edge AI technologies 🤖! Our system detects, diagnoses, and optimizes treatments for diabetes patients. Starting locally in Nigeria 🇳🇬, we aim to make healthcare more accessible, predictive, and personalized for communities that need it the most. 💡

🛠️ Tech Stack
This innovative system is powered by:

Backend: NestJS - A powerful and flexible framework for scalable server-side applications ⚙️.
Frontend: React - A modern and dynamic library for building fast, interactive user interfaces 🎨.
Database: PostgreSQL - A robust and reliable relational database for managing secure health data 📊.
AI Integration: Firebase - Harnessing the power of AI for medical chatbots and intelligent health suggestions 🔮.
Machine Learning Models: Python-based ML models trained for diabetes risk prediction and treatment optimization.
✨ Features
This system is packed with incredible features to improve healthcare:

🔍 AI-powered Diabetes Detection: Advanced AI models provide real-time health insights and early detection capabilities.
📊 Predictive Risk Assessment: Machine learning models forecast diabetes-related risks, helping patients stay proactive.
🤖 AI Chatbot: Get instant, personalized health advice via an AI-powered medical chatbot. It's like having a doctor in your pocket!
⚕️ Optimized Treatment Plans: AI tailors medication and lifestyle recommendations to each patient's unique needs.
🌐 Comprehensive Health Monitoring: Track various health metrics, ensuring total well-being beyond diabetes management.
🏁 Getting Started
Ready to dive in? Follow these steps to set up the project and start changing the future of healthcare! 🚀

🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have these tools installed:

Node.js (v14.x or higher) 🟢
npm 🧩
PostgreSQL (or any SQL database) 💽
A Firebase account for AI-powered features 🔮
Python with relevant ML libraries for model training and integration 🧠
📥 Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Nsiikak/AI-Diabetes-Health-Monitoring-System.git
cd AI-Diabetes-Health-Monitoring-System
Install Backend Dependencies: Navigate to the backend folder and install the required packages.

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm install
Install Frontend Dependencies: Navigate to the frontend folder and install the required packages.

bash
Copy code
cd ../frontend
npm install
Set Up the Database:

Ensure PostgreSQL (or your preferred SQL database) is installed and running 🖥️.
Create a new database for the project and update the database configuration in the backend folder.
Example .env configuration:

bash
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=yourusername
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
DB_NAME=health_monitoring
Set Up Firebase:

Go to Firebase and create a new project.
Add your Firebase configuration details to the .env file:
bash
Copy code
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
Set Up the ML Models:

Navigate to the ml-models folder.
Ensure you have Python and required libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Pandas, etc.) installed.
Train the ML models (diabetes risk prediction, treatment optimization, etc.) using the provided datasets or any custom data.
🚀 Running Locally
Get the project up and running locally in just a few steps:

Backend (NestJS) 🏗️
Start the NestJS server:

bash
Copy code
cd backend
npm run start:dev
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:3000 ⚡.

Frontend (React) 💻
Start the React client:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000 🚀.

Machine Learning Models 🧠
Run the ML models:

Navigate to the ml-models folder and run the necessary scripts for prediction:

bash
Copy code
cd ../ml-models
python predict.py
The trained ML models will analyze user inputs and provide health predictions.

Access the Application 🌐
Frontend: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to access the user-friendly, interactive interface.
Backend API: The API is available at http://localhost:3000/api.
